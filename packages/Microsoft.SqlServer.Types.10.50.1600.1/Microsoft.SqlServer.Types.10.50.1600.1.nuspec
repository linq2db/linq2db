    <description>Sql Server Spatial Types Assembly.

This is the spatial library used in Sql Server 2008. It can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Types.dll if you have Sql Server (or Sql Server Management Studio) installed on your machine. If you don't or you can never find this assembly, then this package is for you :)

Please Microsoft - don't kill me. I mean well. I just want to share your love!
PS. Anyone can download Sql Server Express (for free!) and copy this assembly from the path, listed above .. but having a simple package just saves so much pain.</description>
