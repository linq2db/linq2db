## Public-API surface classification

Used by `/review-pr` and `/verify-review` to turn the `api_changes` list produced by `code-reviewer` into review output (notes vs blocker findings).

### Inputs

- `api_changes` — list of `{namespace, symbol, change, file, line}` entries from `code-reviewer`. Only entries for files under `Source/*` are produced.
- PR milestone title (or `null`).
- List of files changed in the PR (for the suppressions-file check).

### Step 1. Suppressions-file update check

Compute once:

```
suppressions_updated = any file in the PR diff matches the glob
                       Source/**/CompatibilitySuppressions.xml
```

**Deletion gate.** Any `Source/**/CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` that is **deleted** by the PR must be emitted as a `BLK` finding (file-level). These files are the product's public-API baselines — deleting them unblocks `ApiCompat` without re-justifying the suppressions. The deletion is almost always a merge artefact. The finding should state the file path and recommend either (a) restoring the file from `origin/master` if the deletion was incidental, or (b) regenerating with `dotnet pack -p:ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionFile=true` (the `api-baselines` skill) and explicitly confirming that zero suppressions are needed.

### Step 2. Major-release milestone check

A milestone counts as **major release** iff its title matches (case-insensitive):

```
^\d+\.0\.0(-(preview|rc)\.\d+)?$
```

Matches `6.0.0`, `6.0.0-preview.1`, `6.0.0-rc.3`, `6.0.0-RC.2`. The repo's milestone history uses exactly these forms — no `-beta`, no `-alpha`, no space-separated suffixes.

### Step 3. Per-change classification

First, if the `api_changes` list is non-empty, emit **one deduplicated review note**. Checkbox `[x]` if `suppressions_updated`, else `[ ]`. This fires regardless of change type or namespace — the suppressions file needs regenerating whenever the surface shifts.

The note's top line is a maintainer-facing instruction, phrased for a reader who only has shell + `gh` + the repo (see `review-conventions.md` → **Audience**). Do **not** tell the reader to "run the `api-baselines` skill" — that only works inside a Claude Code session. Use the underlying action instead:

> API baselines need a refresh. Regenerate `Source/**/CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` by deleting the existing files and running `dotnet pack -p:ApiCompatGenerateSuppressionFile=true` on every affected project under `Source/`.

Then render `api_changes[]` as a nested sub-list under that top line so the reader can scan the surface delta without parsing a wall of text. Group by kind (`added` / `modified` / `removed`), and under each kind by namespace. Suppress the `LinqToDB.Internal.*` entries entirely (they are not part of the stability contract) unless the group would otherwise be empty. One bullet per symbol, formatted as a short name + kind:

    - [ ] API baselines need a refresh. Regenerate `Source/**/CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` …
      - **Added** under `LinqToDB`:
        - `EagerLoadingStrategy` (enum) — values `Default`, `KeyedQuery`, `CteUnion`
        - `LinqOptions.DefaultEagerLoadingStrategy` (record property)
        - `LinqExtensions.AsUnionQuery<T>` / `AsSeparateQuery<T>` / `AsKeyedQuery<T>` (extension methods)
      - **Modified** under `LinqToDB`:
        - `LinqOptions` (positional record — new primary-constructor parameter)

Keep entries one symbol per bullet. For enum types with many values, collapse values onto the same line as the enum bullet. For overload groups (same method name, multiple signatures) collapse the overloads onto one bullet — the reader just needs to know the surface shape, not every arity. If there are no non-`Internal` symbols for a given kind, omit that sub-heading entirely.

Then, for each `api_changes` entry, decide whether to emit an **additional** finding based on the table below. Entries are classified by their `change` field (one of `"added"`, `"modified"`, `"removed"`).

| Change | Namespace | Milestone | Extra action |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `added` | Equals `LinqToDB.Internal` or starts with `LinqToDB.Internal.` | any | **None.** Additive internal surface never needs review. The baselines-refresh note covers the follow-up work. |
| `added` | Anywhere else (including `LinqToDB`, `LinqToDB.SqlQuery`, etc.) | any | **Run the additive-location sanity check** (step 4). Milestone-wise the change is always allowed — additive public surface is fine in any release — but the reviewer must verify that *public* is the intended visibility for this symbol, rather than `Internal.*` or `private`. |
| `modified` or `removed` | Equals `LinqToDB.Internal` or starts with `LinqToDB.Internal.` | any | None. Internal surface is not a stability contract. |
| `modified` or `removed` | Anywhere else | major-release (per step 2) | Emit one informational note listing the non-`Internal.*` namespaces that had **modified/removed** symbols, so the human reviewer is aware of the breaking surface changes. |
| `modified` or `removed` | Anywhere else | not a major release | Emit a **BLK finding** per change. Title: `Public API modified or removed outside LinqToDB.Internal.*`. Body includes the symbol, file, line, and wording from [`code-design.md`](code-design.md) → **Public API is a contract**: *"Types, method signatures, and observable SQL are a stability contract. This change needs explicit justification and a major-release milestone."* **But first check the SQL AST exception below** — if the symbol is a SQL AST type in `LinqToDB.SqlQuery`, the correct finding is a namespace-placement fix, not a milestone gate. |

### Step 4. Additive-location sanity check

For every `added` entry whose namespace is **not** `LinqToDB.Internal` / `LinqToDB.Internal.*`, evaluate whether the new surface is genuinely intended as public API or whether it leaked out by accident. Allowed ≠ appropriate — the milestone gate is satisfied, but public surface is still a long-term contract, so each newly-exposed symbol should be screened before it locks in.

Three outcomes per `added` entry:

1. **Public is intentional** — user-facing fluent builder, LINQ extension method, documented helper, configuration attribute, etc. No finding.
2. **Should be `LinqToDB.Internal.*`** — the symbol is an implementation building block whose only callers are inside the library itself. Emit a **MAJ** finding per change. Title: `New public API likely belongs in LinqToDB.Internal.*`. Fix: *"Move `<symbol>` to the corresponding `LinqToDB.Internal.*` namespace (or nest it inside an existing Internal type) so it doesn't become a permanent public contract."* Cross-reference [`code-design.md`](code-design.md) → **SQL AST types live in `LinqToDB.Internal.SqlQuery`** when the symbol matches that pattern specifically.
3. **Should be `private` / `internal` / `protected`** — the symbol has no external consumer and no conceptual reason to be visible outside its declaring type. Emit a **MAJ** finding per change. Title: `New public member appears to be an implementation detail`. Fix: *"Reduce visibility of `<symbol>` to `private` / `internal` / `protected` — nothing outside `<containing type>` looks like a legitimate caller."*

**Heuristics for outcome 2 ("should be `Internal.*`"):**

- Type name starts with `Sql` and represents a query-tree node, clause, boundary, or visitor — i.e. a SQL AST type (see SQL AST exception below).
- Type name ends with `Visitor`, `Translator`, `Converter`, `Builder` (non-fluent), `Optimizer`, `Rewriter`, `Walker` — pipeline machinery.
- Type is under a namespace like `Linq.Translation`, `SqlProvider`, `SqlQuery.Visitors`, `Expressions` — package paths that elsewhere contain only Internal surface.
- Type name contains `Info`, `Context`, `State`, `Descriptor`, `Accessor` **and** is only referenced from within the library.
- Method is named `Apply*`, `Visit*`, `Modify*`, `Rewrite*`, `Translate*`, `Build*` on a type that users don't construct directly.

**Heuristics for outcome 3 ("should be `private` / `internal`"):**

- Public constructor on a class instantiated only by the library itself (no user-level factory or `new` documented).
- Public field that looks like mutable implementation state (typical smell: `public readonly List<…>` on a type that has a public `Add` method intended for external callers — but also the inverse: a `public List<…> Foo` field on a class never mentioned in user docs).
- Public method whose signature references AST / translator / internal-only parameter types (e.g. `SqlExpression`, `ISqlExpressionTranslator`) — if the parameter type isn't part of the user-facing API, neither is the method.
- Nested helper class that only appears in the body of its outer type's methods.

**When uncertain**, emit a **SUG** finding instead of MAJ — worded as a question: *"`<symbol>` looks like an internal detail — is public visibility intentional?"* — so the author confirms rather than being asked to take action.

This check runs regardless of milestone. It is a design-quality gate, not a stability gate: the cost of relaxing visibility later is zero; the cost of reducing visibility later is a breaking change.

### SQL AST namespace exception

Before emitting a BLK per the last row above, check whether the modified / removed symbol is a SQL AST type (query-tree building block used only during query construction, translation, and rendering) that happens to live under the public `LinqToDB.SqlQuery` namespace rather than `LinqToDB.Internal.SqlQuery` where it belongs. See [`code-design.md`](code-design.md) → **SQL AST types live in `LinqToDB.Internal.SqlQuery`** for the underlying rule.

For those cases, emit a BLK whose **Fix** is *"Move `<TypeName>` to `LinqToDB.Internal.SqlQuery` as part of this PR — the signature change then becomes AST-internal and no longer trips ApiCompat."* — not the milestone-gate wording above. The legacy classes currently under `LinqToDB.SqlQuery` include `SqlFrameClause`, `SqlExtendedFunction`, `SqlSearchCondition`, `SqlFrameBoundary`, and similar AST nodes; some carry a `// TODO: v7 - move to internal namespace` marker. When in doubt, check whether the type is referenced only from query-building / translation / SQL-rendering code — if yes, it's AST and belongs internal.

### Notes

- The baselines-refresh note is deduplicated — at most one appears in the review regardless of how many changes triggered it.
- Additive changes (`change: "added"`) never produce milestone-gated BLK findings — they are always allowed surface-expansion. They *can* produce MAJ / SUG findings from the step-4 location sanity check when the new symbol looks misplaced (should be `Internal.*` or should be `private` / `internal`). Additive changes in namespaces starting with `LinqToDB.Internal` skip step 4 entirely.
- When a PR has both `Internal.*` changes and non-`Internal.*` changes under a major-release milestone, only the single deduplicated note plus (if any modifications/removals exist) the one informational note appear — no BLK findings. Step-4 findings on additive non-Internal entries are independent of the milestone and may still appear.
- `/verify-review` reapplies this classification from scratch against the current `api_changes`. It does not try to reconcile against the prior classification.
