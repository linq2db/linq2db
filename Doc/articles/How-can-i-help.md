# How can I help the project?

Certainly the best would be pull requests with issue fixing (please read [this guide](xref:contrib) before creating PR). 

If you are not ready to start as developer you can:
1. Write XML documentation. Yes, this thing we do really need - XML documentation with samples. You can take any undocumented public class or method and document it and make pull requests.
1. Stories - you can tell your friends about linq2db, also you can post some samples and guides, it would be really great.
1. Testing! It is really great if you can spent some of tour time to run your projects tests with new RC version.

## Testing how to
1. Open new issue "Invite me to testers team", we'll send you an invitation.
1. Before each official release new PR would be created with notifying all teammates.
1. The thin you need is to update to latest RC package from MyGet and run your test, if smth. is wrong please report us, if everything is alright just approve PR
