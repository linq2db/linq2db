# Getting Started with LINQ To DB on .NET Framework

These tutorials require no previous knowledge of LINQ To DB or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple .NET Framework Console Application that queries and saves data from a database.

You can use the techniques learned in these tutorials in any application that targets the .NET Framework, including WPF and WinForms.

> [!NOTE]  
> These tutorials and the accompanying samples have been updated to use LINQ To DB 2.1.0. However, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create applications that use previous releases, with minimal modification to the instructions.
